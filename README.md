# DarkPanSix
Tools for building a private Perl6 library Ecosystem

## Plans :

- Script for modifying your zef config file to ensure your personal ecosystem is available.
- Script for creating a combined Meta.json file that can be deployed to a webservice or git
- Dockerfiles for each of these
- Documentation on using them.
